  	project(':react-native-android-text-to-speech').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-android-text-to-speech/android')
  	```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
  	```
      compile project(':react-native-android-text-to-speech')
  	```


## Usage

This wrapper library's function uses Promises instead of callbacks. The ".then()" or es2016's `async await`(recommended) keywords should be used. 

### Imports

```js
import AndroidTextToSpeech from 'react-native-tts';
``` 

### Speaking

1) Use the function `AndroidTextToSpeech.speak(utterance, queueMode)` to use the default TTS engine to speak. Where
'utterance' is of type string.
'queueMode' can have values -
			1. "ADD" - to add to the TTS play queue.
			2. "FLUSH" - to interrupt the TTS play queue with the utterance and then flush it.
Returns a promise with utteranceId.

Example -
```js
AndroidTextToSpeech.speak('Hello, world!', 'ADD');
```

2) Use the function `AndroidTextToSpeech.stop()` to stop speaking and flush the TTS play queue.
Return a promise with "success".

```js
AndroidTextToSpeech.stop();
```

### Ducking

Ducking is meant to lower other applications output sound level while speaking.
It can be enabled by using function `AndroidTextToSpeech.setDucking(enable)`. Where 'enable' is a boolean value.
Return a promise with success.

Example-
```js
AndroidTextToSpeech.setDucking(true)
```
